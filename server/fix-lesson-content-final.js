    'Skip Counting by 5s': {
        grade2: {
            introduction: "Get ready to become a skip counting superhero! We're going to learn how to count by 5s, which is like taking giant kangaroo hops instead of tiny baby steps. When you skip count by 5s, you jump over numbers and land on every 5th number - it's going to be super fun!",
            content: `**What Is Skip Counting by 5s?**

Skip counting by 5s means we count in jumps of 5 instead of counting every single number. Instead of saying 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, we jump and say 5, 10! It's like being a math kangaroo!

**Why Skip Counting by 5s Matters**

Learning to skip count by 5s helps you count faster and is super useful in real life. When you count nickels (which are worth 5 cents each), you skip count by 5s! It also helps you tell time on a clock because the minute marks go by 5s.

**How Skip Counting by 5s Works**

Start at 5, then add 5 more each time:
• 5 (that's 1 group of 5)
• 10 (that's 2 groups of 5) 
• 15 (that's 3 groups of 5)
• 20 (that's 4 groups of 5)

Think of it like this: If you have 5 fingers on each hand, how many fingers do you have on 2 hands? Skip count: 5, 10!

**Real-Life Examples**

• Counting your fingers and toes (5, 10, 15, 20)
• Counting nickels in your piggy bank
• Counting by 5-minute marks on a clock
• Counting groups of 5 stickers or toys

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't mix up skip counting with regular counting. When skip counting by 5s, you don't say the numbers in between. Jump right from 5 to 10, not 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

**Quick Recap**

Skip counting by 5s is jumping by 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. It's faster than counting by 1s and helps you in many real-life situations!`,

    'Subtraction Within 100': {
        grade2: {
            introduction: "Welcome to the world of subtraction superheroes! Today we're going to learn how to subtract numbers within 100. Think of subtraction as taking things away or finding the difference between two groups. It's like being a detective who figures out how many are missing!",
            content: `**What Is Subtraction Within 100?**

Subtraction within 100 means taking away smaller numbers from bigger numbers, where all the numbers are 100 or less. When we subtract, we find out how many are left or what the difference is between two numbers.

**Why Subtraction Within 100 Matters**

You use subtraction every day! When you spend money and want to know how much you have left, when you eat some cookies and want to know how many remain, or when you're playing games and keeping score.

**How Subtraction Within 100 Works**

There are different ways to subtract:

**Counting Back Method:**
For 15 - 6, start at 15 and count back 6 numbers:
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9
Answer: 9

**Number Line Method:**
Use a number line and hop backwards from the bigger number.

**Breaking Apart Method:**
For 43 - 27:
• Break 27 into 20 + 7
• First subtract 20: 43 - 20 = 23
• Then subtract 7: 23 - 7 = 16

**Real-Life Examples**

• You have 25 stickers and give away 8 - how many do you have left?
• There are 50 kids at the playground and 12 go home - how many are still playing?
• You save $30 and spend $15 on a toy - how much money do you have left?

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Remember that you always subtract the smaller number from the bigger number (unless you're learning about negative numbers later). Also, when borrowing in column subtraction, don't forget to reduce the number you borrowed from.

**Quick Recap**

Subtraction within 100 means taking away or finding differences between numbers up to 100. Practice with different methods to find what works best for you!`,

    'Shapes and Their Properties': {

            introduction: "Welcome to the amazing world of shapes! Today we're going to explore shapes and their special properties. Shapes are everywhere around us - in buildings, toys, nature, and even in the food we eat. Get ready to become a shape detective!",
            content: `**What Are Shapes and Their Properties?**

Shapes are forms that have certain characteristics or properties. Properties are special features that help us identify and describe shapes, like how many sides they have, whether the sides are straight or curved, and how many corners they have.

**Why Shapes and Their Properties Matter**

Understanding shapes helps us describe the world around us. Architects use shapes to design buildings, artists use shapes in their artwork, and even nature follows shape patterns like hexagons in honeycomb!

**How Shapes and Their Properties Work**

**Common 2D Shapes:**
• **Circle:** Round shape with no sides or corners, all points are the same distance from the center
• **Triangle:** Has 3 sides and 3 corners (vertices)
• **Square:** Has 4 equal sides and 4 right angles (corners)
• **Rectangle:** Has 4 sides with opposite sides equal and 4 right angles

**Common 3D Shapes:**
• **Sphere:** Like a ball, round in all directions
• **Cube:** Like a dice, has 6 square faces
• **Cylinder:** Like a can, has circular ends and a curved side

**Real-Life Examples**

• Windows are usually rectangles or squares
• Wheels are circles
• Ice cream cones are triangular
• Dice are cubes
• Balls are spheres

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't confuse squares and rectangles - all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares! Also, remember that circles don't have any sides or corners like other shapes do.

**Quick Recap**

Shapes have special properties like numbers of sides, corners, and angles. Learning these properties helps us understand and describe the world around us better!`,

    // Grade 4 Math lessons
    'Area and Perimeter': {
        grade4: {
            introduction: "Welcome to the exciting world of area and perimeter! Today we're going to master these important concepts that architects, farmers, and designers use every day. Think of perimeter as the fence around your yard and area as the grass inside the fence!",
            content: `**Understanding Area and Perimeter**

**Perimeter** is the distance around the outside edge of a shape - like walking around the border of a soccer field. **Area** is the amount of space inside a shape - like how much carpet you'd need to cover a room floor.

**Why Area and Perimeter Are Important**

These measurements help us solve real-world problems:
• Farmers calculate area to know how much seed to plant
• Builders calculate perimeter to know how much fencing to buy
• Interior designers calculate area to know how much flooring is needed
• Gardeners use both to plan flower beds and walkways

**How Area and Perimeter Work**

**For Rectangles:**
• Perimeter = 2 × length + 2 × width (or add all four sides)
• Area = length × width

**For Squares:**
• Perimeter = 4 × side length
• Area = side × side

**Example:** A rectangle garden that is 8 feet long and 5 feet wide
• Perimeter = 8 + 5 + 8 + 5 = 26 feet (how much fence needed)
• Area = 8 × 5 = 40 square feet (how much soil needed)

**Advanced Concepts**

For irregular shapes, break them into rectangles and squares, then add the areas together. For perimeter, measure each side separately.

**Units Matter!**
• Perimeter is measured in linear units (feet, meters, inches)
• Area is measured in square units (square feet, square meters)

**Real-World Applications**

• Sports field dimensions
• Room renovations
• Garden planning
• Wrapping presents
• Art and design projects

**Critical Thinking**

Can two shapes have the same perimeter but different areas? Yes! A long, narrow rectangle and a square can have identical perimeters but very different areas.

**Summary**

Area and perimeter are essential tools for measuring and planning. Understanding both helps you solve practical problems and think like an engineer or architect!`,

        return `**What Are Fractions?**

Fractions are like pieces of a puzzle or slices of a pizza! When you break something whole into equal parts, each part is called a fraction. It's like sharing - when you split a cookie in half, each half is a fraction of the whole cookie!

**Why Fractions Matter**

You use fractions every day without even knowing it! When you eat half a sandwich, drink a quarter of your milk, or share toys equally with friends, you're using fractions. They help us share things fairly and measure parts of wholes.

**How Fractions Work**

A fraction has two parts:
• The bottom number (denominator) tells you how many equal pieces the whole thing is divided into
• The top number (numerator) tells you how many pieces you have

For example, in 1/2:
• The 2 means the whole is cut into 2 equal pieces
• The 1 means you have 1 of those pieces

**Real-Life Examples**

• Pizza slices - if you eat 2 slices out of 8, you ate 2/8 of the pizza
• Time - half an hour is 1/2 of a whole hour
• Money - a quarter coin is 1/4 of a dollar
• Sharing - if 3 friends share 6 cookies equally, each gets 2/6 of the cookies

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't think bigger numbers always mean bigger fractions! 1/2 is actually bigger than 1/4, even though 4 is bigger than 2. Think of it like pizza - half a pizza is more than a quarter of a pizza!

**Quick Recap**

Fractions are parts of a whole. The bottom number shows how many equal pieces there are, and the top number shows how many pieces you have. Fractions help us share and measure parts of things!`;
    } else {
        return `**What Are Fractions?**

Fractions represent parts of a whole or equal parts of a set. They are rational numbers that express the relationship between a part and the whole, allowing us to work with quantities that fall between whole numbers.

**Why Fractions Matter**

Fractions are essential for understanding proportional relationships, measurement, probability, and advanced mathematical concepts. They appear in cooking recipes, construction measurements, scientific calculations, and financial planning.

**How Fractions Work**

A fraction consists of:
• Numerator (top number): indicates how many parts we have
• Denominator (bottom number): indicates total equal parts in the whole
• The fraction bar represents division

Key concepts include:
• Equivalent fractions (different forms of the same value)
• Proper fractions (numerator < denominator)
• Improper fractions (numerator ≥ denominator)
• Mixed numbers (whole number + fraction)

**Real-Life Examples**

• Recipe measurements (3/4 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt)
• Construction and engineering (precise measurements and tolerances)
• Statistics and data analysis (representing portions of populations)
• Financial calculations (interest rates, stock prices, percentages)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't add fractions by adding numerators and denominators separately - you must find common denominators first. Also, remember that larger denominators create smaller fraction values when numerators are equal.

**Quick Recap**

Fractions represent parts of wholes and are fundamental to advanced mathematics. Understanding equivalent fractions, operations, and real-world applications builds a strong foundation for algebra and beyond.`;

        return `**What Are Addition and Subtraction?**

Addition and subtraction are like magic math tools! Addition is putting things together to make bigger groups (like collecting stickers), and subtraction is taking things away to make smaller groups (like eating cookies from a jar). They're opposites that work together!

**Why Addition and Subtraction Matter**

You use these every day! When you count your toys, figure out how much money you have, or see how many cookies are left after snack time, you're using addition and subtraction. They help you solve everyday problems!

**How Addition and Subtraction Work**

**Addition (+):**
When you add, you put groups together:
• 3 apples + 2 apples = 5 apples total
• Start with the first number, then count up by the second number

**Subtraction (−):**
When you subtract, you take away from a group:
• 5 cookies − 2 cookies = 3 cookies left
• Start with the bigger number, then count backwards

**Real-Life Examples**

• You have 4 toy cars and get 3 more for your birthday: 4 + 3 = 7 cars
• There are 10 birds in a tree and 4 fly away: 10 − 4 = 6 birds left
• You save 5 dollars, then spend 2 dollars: 5 − 2 = 3 dollars remaining
• Two friends bring 6 stickers each to trade: 6 + 6 = 12 stickers total

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Remember the order matters in subtraction! You can't take 8 away from 3 (you'd need more than 3 to start with). In addition, order doesn't matter - 2 + 5 is the same as 5 + 2.

**Quick Recap**

Addition puts things together to make bigger amounts, and subtraction takes things away to make smaller amounts. These are some of the most useful math skills you'll ever learn!`;
    } else {
        return `**What Are Addition and Subtraction?**

Addition and subtraction are fundamental arithmetic operations that form the basis for all mathematical computation. Addition combines quantities to find totals, while subtraction finds differences between quantities or determines remaining amounts.

**Why Addition and Subtraction Matter**

These operations are essential for problem-solving across all areas of mathematics and real-world applications. They support understanding of number relationships, algebraic thinking, and complex mathematical reasoning.

**How Addition and Subtraction Work**

**Addition principles:**
• Commutative property: order doesn't matter (a + b = b + a)
• Associative property: grouping doesn't matter ((a + b) + c = a + (b + c))
• Identity property: adding zero doesn't change the value (a + 0 = a)

**Subtraction principles:**
• Not commutative: order matters (a − b ≠ b − a)
• Relationship to addition: subtraction is the inverse of addition
• Can be verified by addition: if a − b = c, then c + b = a

**Real-Life Examples**

• Financial calculations: budgeting, banking, expense tracking
• Measurement: calculating distances, differences in temperature
• Data analysis: finding changes over time, comparing quantities
• Problem-solving: determining needed resources, calculating changes

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't confuse regrouping (borrowing) in subtraction with carrying in addition. Also, be careful with word problems - identify whether you're combining quantities (addition) or finding differences/remaining amounts (subtraction).

**Quick Recap**

Addition and subtraction are inverse operations that form the foundation of mathematical thinking. Mastering these operations and their properties enables success in algebra, geometry, and advanced mathematics.`;

function generateMultiplicationContent(grade) {
    if (grade === 4) {
        return `**What Is Multiplication?**

Multiplication is like addition's super-speedy cousin! Instead of adding the same number over and over again, multiplication lets you jump to the answer quickly. Think of it as counting groups of things all at once - it's like having a math superpower!

**Why Multiplication Matters**

Multiplication helps you solve problems faster and understand patterns in numbers. You'll use it for calculating areas, finding totals in equal groups, understanding arrays, and solving real-world problems involving repeated addition.

**How Multiplication Works**

Multiplication has special properties that make it powerful:
• It's repeated addition: 4 × 3 means 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
• Order doesn't matter: 4 × 3 = 3 × 4 (commutative property)
• You can break apart numbers: 6 × 8 = (6 × 4) + (6 × 4) = 24 + 24 = 48

**Multiplication strategies:**
• Arrays: arrange objects in equal rows and columns
• Skip counting: count by groups (2, 4, 6, 8 for 2×4)
• Doubling: use known facts to find new ones
• Breaking apart: split larger numbers into easier parts

**Real-Life Examples**

• If you buy 3 packs of gum with 5 pieces each: 3 × 5 = 15 pieces total
• A classroom has 6 rows of desks with 4 desks in each row: 6 × 4 = 24 desks
• You save $7 per week for 8 weeks: 7 × 8 = $56 saved
• A garden has 9 rows with 6 plants each: 9 × 6 = 54 plants total

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't forget that any number times zero equals zero, and any number times one stays the same. Also, be careful with word problems - look for keywords like "groups of," "each," "per," and "times" that signal multiplication.

**Quick Recap**

Multiplication is repeated addition that helps you calculate quickly and efficiently. Understanding multiplication facts, properties, and strategies will make you a confident problem-solver!`;

function generatePlaceValueContent(grade) {
    if (grade === 2) {
        return `**What Is Place Value?**

Place value is like giving each number digit a special job! Every digit in a number has its own important place, just like how each player on a sports team has their own position. The place where a digit sits tells us how much it's really worth!

**Why Place Value Matters**

Understanding place value helps you read big numbers, do math problems correctly, and understand how our number system works. It's like learning the secret code that makes all numbers make sense!

**How Place Value Works**

Each place has a special value:
• Ones place: worth exactly what the digit says (5 ones = 5)
• Tens place: worth 10 times the digit (5 tens = 50)
• Hundreds place: worth 100 times the digit (5 hundreds = 500)

For the number 347:
• 3 is in the hundreds place, so it means 300
• 4 is in the tens place, so it means 40  
• 7 is in the ones place, so it means 7
• Together: 300 + 40 + 7 = 347

**Real-Life Examples**

• House numbers: 123 Oak Street means 1 hundred, 2 tens, 3 ones
• Money: $248 means 2 hundred-dollar bills, 4 ten-dollar bills, 8 one-dollar bills
• Scoreboards: A score of 156 means 1 hundred, 5 tens, 6 ones
• Page numbers: Page 89 means 8 tens and 9 ones

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't think that bigger digits are always worth more! In the number 19, the 1 is worth 10 and the 9 is worth 9, so the 1 is actually worth more because of its place.

**Quick Recap**

Place value tells us what each digit in a number is really worth based on where it sits. Understanding place value helps you read, write, and work with numbers correctly!`;
    } else {
        return `**What Is Place Value?**

Place value is the foundation of our base-ten number system, where the position of each digit determines its actual value. This positional system allows us to represent any quantity using just ten digits (0-9) by assigning different values to different positions.

**Why Place Value Matters**

Place value understanding is essential for all mathematical operations, number sense development, and working with large numbers. It underlies decimal operations, scientific notation, and helps students understand number relationships and patterns.

**How Place Value Works**

Our decimal system is based on powers of 10:
• Each place value is 10 times greater than the place to its right
• Each place value is 1/10 the value of the place to its left
• Standard form, expanded form, and word form all represent the same value

Example with 5,847:
• 5 thousands = 5 × 1,000 = 5,000
• 8 hundreds = 8 × 100 = 800
• 4 tens = 4 × 10 = 40
• 7 ones = 7 × 1 = 7
• Total value: 5,000 + 800 + 40 + 7 = 5,847

**Real-Life Examples**

• Population statistics and large data sets
• Scientific measurements and calculations
• Financial calculations and monetary systems
• Geographic measurements (distances, elevations)
• Technology (computer memory, processing speeds)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't confuse digit value with place value - the digit 5 always represents five of something, but its place determines what it's five of (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.). Also, remember that zero serves as a placeholder to maintain correct place values.

**Quick Recap**

Place value is the positional system that gives meaning to digits based on their location in a number. Mastering place value concepts is essential for number sense and all mathematical operations.`;

function generateMeasurementContent(grade) {
    if (grade === 2) {
        return `**What Is Measurement?**

Measurement is like being a detective who figures out how big, long, heavy, or full something is! We use special tools and units to describe the size of things around us. It's like giving everything a number so we can compare and understand them better!

**Why Measurement Matters**

You use measurement every day! When you see how tall you've grown, check if your clothes fit, or help cook dinner by measuring ingredients, you're using measurement skills. It helps us build things, share fairly, and understand our world!

**How Measurement Works**

We measure different things in different ways:
• **Length:** How long or tall something is (inches, feet, centimeters)
• **Weight:** How heavy something is (pounds, ounces, kilograms)  
• **Volume:** How much liquid fits in something (cups, pints, liters)
• **Time:** How long something takes (seconds, minutes, hours)

**Tools we use:**
• Rulers and measuring tapes for length
• Scales for weight
• Measuring cups for liquids
• Clocks and timers for time

**Real-Life Examples**

• Measuring your height to see how much you've grown
• Using measuring cups to make cookies with the right amount of flour
• Weighing packages at the post office to know how much postage costs
• Timing how long it takes to run around the playground

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Always start measuring from the zero mark on your ruler, not from the end! Also, make sure you're using the right unit - don't measure a pencil in feet or your height in inches (well, you could, but it would be a really big number!).

**Quick Recap**

Measurement helps us describe the size, weight, volume, and time of things around us. Using the right tools and units helps us measure accurately and communicate clearly with others!`;
    } else {
        return `**What Is Measurement?**

        return `**What Is Geometry?**

Geometry is the study of shapes, sizes, and how things fit together in space! It's like being a shape detective who explores circles, squares, triangles, and all the amazing shapes we see around us every day. Everything has a shape - even you!

**Why Geometry Matters**

Shapes are everywhere! Understanding geometry helps you describe the world around you, build with blocks, draw pictures, solve puzzles, and even understand how buildings and bridges are made. It's like having a special language for talking about shapes!

**How Geometry Works**

We learn about different kinds of shapes:
• **2D shapes (flat):** circles, squares, rectangles, triangles
• **3D shapes (solid):** spheres (balls), cubes (dice), cylinders (cans)
• **Shape properties:** sides, corners, edges, faces

We also learn about:
• How shapes can be the same or different
• How to sort shapes by their properties
• How shapes fit together to make patterns
• How to find shapes in everyday objects

**Real-Life Examples**

• Windows are usually rectangles or squares
• Wheels on cars and bikes are circles
• Ice cream cones are shaped like triangles on top of cylinders
• Dice are cubes with 6 square faces
• Soccer balls are spheres covered with pentagons and hexagons

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't think all rectangles are squares - squares are special rectangles where all sides are equal! Also, remember that a circle doesn't have any sides or corners like other shapes do.

**Quick Recap**

Geometry is all about shapes and how they work together. Learning about 2D and 3D shapes, their properties, and where we find them helps us understand and describe our world better!`;
    } else {

Weather is what's happening outside your window right now - is it sunny, rainy, windy, or snowy? Climate is like weather's bigger picture - it tells us what the weather is usually like in a place over a long, long time. Think of weather as today's outfit and climate as your whole wardrobe!

**Why Weather and Climate Matter**

Understanding weather helps you know what to wear, what activities you can do outside, and when to take an umbrella! Learning about climate helps you understand why some places are always hot, some are always cold, and some change with the seasons.

**How Weather and Climate Work**

**Weather changes every day:**
• Temperature (hot, warm, cool, cold)
• Precipitation (rain, snow, hail, sleet)
• Wind (still, breezy, windy, gusty)
• Sky conditions (sunny, cloudy, partly cloudy, overcast)

**Climate is the pattern over many years:**
• Some places are usually hot (like deserts)
• Some places are usually cold (like the North Pole)
• Some places have four seasons with different weather
• Some places are usually wet or usually dry

**Real-Life Examples**

• You check the weather to decide if you need a jacket
• Farmers use weather and climate to know when to plant crops
• Animals migrate based on seasonal weather changes
• People plan vacations based on typical climate in different places

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't confuse weather and climate! Weather is what happens today, but climate is what usually happens over many, many years. One cold day doesn't change the climate!

**Quick Recap**

Plants and animals are living things that share our amazing planet! Plants are like nature's food makers - they use sunlight, water, and air to grow and make their own food. Animals are living creatures that move around, eat food, and have babies. Together, they make Earth a colorful, exciting place to live!

**Why Plants and Animals Matter**

Plants and animals are super important because they help each other and help us too! Plants give us oxygen to breathe, food to eat, and homes for animals. Animals help plants by spreading seeds and making the soil rich. Without plants and animals, our world would be very different!

**How Plants and Animals Work**

**Plants need:**
• Sunlight for energy (like how you need food for energy)
• Water from rain or watering
• Air (carbon dioxide) to breathe
• Soil with nutrients to grow strong roots

**Animals need:**
• Food to eat (plants, other animals, or both)
• Water to drink
• Air (oxygen) to breathe  
• Shelter to stay safe and warm
• Space to live and raise babies

**Real-Life Examples**

• Trees in your yard make oxygen for you to breathe
• Bees collect nectar from flowers and help flowers make seeds
• Squirrels eat nuts and bury some, which grow into new trees
• Your pet needs food, water, and a safe place to live, just like wild animals

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't think plants can't do anything because they don't move around - they're actually very busy making food, cleaning the air, and growing! Also, remember that all animals (including people) depend on plants for survival.

**Quick Recap**

Plants and animals are living things that need different things to survive, but they help each other and make our world beautiful and healthy. Taking care of plants and animals means taking care of our planet!`;

function generateStatesOfMatterContent(grade) {
    if (grade === 2) {
        return `**What Are States of Matter?**

Matter is everything around us that we can touch, feel, or see! Matter can be in different states - like how water can be liquid in your cup, solid ice in your freezer, or steam from a kettle. Let's explore these amazing states!

**Why States of Matter Matter**

Understanding states of matter helps us know how things change in our world. It explains why ice cream melts on a hot day, why puddles disappear in the sun, and why we see clouds in the sky!

**How States of Matter Work**

There are three main states of matter:

**Solids:**
• Keep their shape (like toys and books)
• Feel hard or firm
• Can't flow or pour
• Examples: rocks, ice cubes, pencils

**Liquids:**
• Take the shape of their container
• Can be poured
• Flow easily
• Examples: water, milk, juice

**Gases:**
• Spread out to fill all space
• Can't be seen (most times)
• Can move through air
• Examples: air, steam, balloon gas

**Changes in States:**
• Melting: solid → liquid (ice cream melting)
• Freezing: liquid → solid (making ice cubes)
• Evaporation: liquid → gas (puddles drying up)
• Condensation: gas → liquid (foggy bathroom mirror)

**Real-Life Examples**

• Making popsicles (liquid juice → frozen solid)
• Morning dew on grass (gas → liquid)
• Chocolate melting in your hand (solid → liquid)
• Boiling water for pasta (liquid → gas)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Remember that changing state doesn't change what something is - water is still water whether it's ice, liquid, or steam! Also, not all solids melt at the same temperature - chocolate melts easily but rocks need much more heat.

**Quick Recap**

Everything is made of matter, and matter can be a solid, liquid, or gas. Matter can change from one state to another when heated or cooled. These changes happen all around us every day!`;
    } else {
        return `**What Are States of Matter?**
