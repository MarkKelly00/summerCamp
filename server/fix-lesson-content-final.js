    'Skip Counting by 5s': {
        grade2: {
            introduction: "Get ready to become a skip counting superhero! We're going to learn how to count by 5s, which is like taking giant kangaroo hops instead of tiny baby steps. When you skip count by 5s, you jump over numbers and land on every 5th number - it's going to be super fun!",
            content: `**What Is Skip Counting by 5s?**

Skip counting by 5s means we count in jumps of 5 instead of counting every single number. Instead of saying 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, we jump and say 5, 10! It's like being a math kangaroo!

**Why Skip Counting by 5s Matters**

Learning to skip count by 5s helps you count faster and is super useful in real life. When you count nickels (which are worth 5 cents each), you skip count by 5s! It also helps you tell time on a clock because the minute marks go by 5s.

**How Skip Counting by 5s Works**

Start at 5, then add 5 more each time:
• 5 (that's 1 group of 5)
• 10 (that's 2 groups of 5) 
• 15 (that's 3 groups of 5)
• 20 (that's 4 groups of 5)

Think of it like this: If you have 5 fingers on each hand, how many fingers do you have on 2 hands? Skip count: 5, 10!

**Real-Life Examples**

• Counting your fingers and toes (5, 10, 15, 20)
• Counting nickels in your piggy bank
• Counting by 5-minute marks on a clock
• Counting groups of 5 stickers or toys

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't mix up skip counting with regular counting. When skip counting by 5s, you don't say the numbers in between. Jump right from 5 to 10, not 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

**Quick Recap**

Skip counting by 5s is jumping by 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. It's faster than counting by 1s and helps you in many real-life situations!`,

    'Subtraction Within 100': {
        grade2: {
            introduction: "Welcome to the world of subtraction superheroes! Today we're going to learn how to subtract numbers within 100. Think of subtraction as taking things away or finding the difference between two groups. It's like being a detective who figures out how many are missing!",
            content: `**What Is Subtraction Within 100?**

Subtraction within 100 means taking away smaller numbers from bigger numbers, where all the numbers are 100 or less. When we subtract, we find out how many are left or what the difference is between two numbers.

**Why Subtraction Within 100 Matters**

You use subtraction every day! When you spend money and want to know how much you have left, when you eat some cookies and want to know how many remain, or when you're playing games and keeping score.

**How Subtraction Within 100 Works**

There are different ways to subtract:

**Counting Back Method:**
For 15 - 6, start at 15 and count back 6 numbers:
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9
Answer: 9

**Number Line Method:**
Use a number line and hop backwards from the bigger number.

**Breaking Apart Method:**
For 43 - 27:
• Break 27 into 20 + 7
• First subtract 20: 43 - 20 = 23
• Then subtract 7: 23 - 7 = 16

**Real-Life Examples**

• You have 25 stickers and give away 8 - how many do you have left?
• There are 50 kids at the playground and 12 go home - how many are still playing?
• You save $30 and spend $15 on a toy - how much money do you have left?

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Remember that you always subtract the smaller number from the bigger number (unless you're learning about negative numbers later). Also, when borrowing in column subtraction, don't forget to reduce the number you borrowed from.

**Quick Recap**

Subtraction within 100 means taking away or finding differences between numbers up to 100. Practice with different methods to find what works best for you!`,

            content: `**What Are Shapes and Their Properties?**

Shapes are forms that have certain characteristics or properties. Properties are special features that help us identify and describe shapes, like how many sides they have, whether the sides are straight or curved, and how many corners they have.

**Why Shapes and Their Properties Matter**

Understanding shapes helps us describe the world around us. Architects use shapes to design buildings, artists use shapes in their artwork, and even nature follows shape patterns like hexagons in honeycomb!

**How Shapes and Their Properties Work**

**Common 2D Shapes:**
• **Circle:** Round shape with no sides or corners, all points are the same distance from the center
• **Triangle:** Has 3 sides and 3 corners (vertices)
• **Square:** Has 4 equal sides and 4 right angles (corners)
• **Rectangle:** Has 4 sides with opposite sides equal and 4 right angles

**Common 3D Shapes:**
• **Sphere:** Like a ball, round in all directions
• **Cube:** Like a dice, has 6 square faces
• **Cylinder:** Like a can, has circular ends and a curved side

**Real-Life Examples**

• Windows are usually rectangles or squares
• Wheels are circles
• Ice cream cones are triangular
• Dice are cubes
• Balls are spheres

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't confuse squares and rectangles - all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares! Also, remember that circles don't have sides or corners like other shapes.

**Quick Recap**

Shapes have special properties like numbers of sides, corners, and angles. Learning these properties helps us understand and describe the world around us!`,

    'Area and Perimeter': {
        grade4: {
            introduction: "Welcome to the exciting world of area and perimeter! Today we're going to master these important concepts that architects, farmers, and designers use every day. Think of perimeter as the fence around your yard and area as the grass inside the fence!",
            content: `**Understanding Area and Perimeter**

**Perimeter** is the distance around the outside edge of a shape - like walking around the border of a soccer field. **Area** is the amount of space inside a shape - like how much carpet you'd need to cover a room floor.

**Why Area and Perimeter Are Important**

These measurements help us solve real-world problems:
• Farmers calculate area to know how much seed to plant
• Builders calculate perimeter to know how much fencing to buy
• Interior designers calculate area to know how much flooring is needed
• Gardeners use both to plan flower beds and walkways

**How Area and Perimeter Work**

**For Rectangles:**
• Perimeter = 2 × length + 2 × width (or add all four sides)
• Area = length × width

**For Squares:**
• Perimeter = 4 × side length
• Area = side × side

**Example:** A rectangle garden that is 8 feet long and 5 feet wide
• Perimeter = 8 + 5 + 8 + 5 = 26 feet (how much fence needed)
• Area = 8 × 5 = 40 square feet (how much soil needed)

**Advanced Concepts**

For irregular shapes, break them into rectangles and squares, then add the areas together. For perimeter, measure each side separately.

**Units Matter!**
• Perimeter is measured in linear units (feet, meters, inches)
• Area is measured in square units (square feet, square meters)

**Real-World Applications**

• Sports field dimensions
• Room renovations
• Garden planning
• Wrapping presents
• Art and design projects

**Critical Thinking**

Can two shapes have the same perimeter but different areas? Yes! A long, narrow rectangle and a square can have identical perimeters but very different areas.

**Summary**

Area and perimeter are essential tools for measuring and planning. Understanding both helps you solve practical problems and think like an engineer or architect!`,

Animal habitats are like homes for animals - special places where they live, find food, and raise their babies! Adaptations are like superpowers that help animals survive in their homes. Just like you might wear a jacket when it's cold, animals have special features that help them stay safe and healthy.

**Why Animal Habitats and Adaptations Matter**

Learning about where animals live and how they survive helps us understand nature and take care of our planet. It's like being a nature detective - you can figure out why a polar bear has thick fur and why a fish has gills!

**How Animal Habitats and Adaptations Work**

Animals choose habitats that give them everything they need:
• Food to eat (like how rabbits live in places with lots of grass)
• Water to drink (like how hippos live near rivers)
• Shelter to stay safe (like how birds build nests in trees)
• The right temperature (like how penguins live where it's cold)

Adaptations help them survive:
• Sharp claws help cats catch food
• Thick fur keeps animals warm
• Big ears help elephants stay cool
• Webbed feet help ducks swim

**Real-Life Examples**

• Desert animals like camels can go without water for days
• Arctic foxes have extra-thick fur in winter that turns white for camouflage
• Giraffes have long necks to reach leaves high up in trees
• Fish have gills to breathe underwater, while whales have lungs and must come up for air

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't think all animals can live anywhere - each animal needs its special habitat! Also, remember that adaptations take a very long time to develop, not just a few days.

**Quick Recap**

Animals live in habitats that meet their needs, and they have special adaptations (like superpowers) that help them survive. Every animal is perfectly designed for its home!`;
    } else {
        return `**What Are Animal Habitats and Adaptations?**

Animal habitats are specific environments where organisms have evolved to live and thrive, while adaptations are inherited characteristics that help animals survive in their particular environments. These concepts work together to explain how life has diversified across Earth's many ecosystems.

**Why Animal Habitats and Adaptations Matter**

Understanding these concepts helps us comprehend biodiversity, evolution, and conservation. This knowledge is crucial for protecting endangered species, managing ecosystems, and understanding how climate change affects wildlife populations.

**How Animal Habitats and Adaptations Work**

Habitats provide essential resources:
• Food sources and foraging opportunities
• Fresh water and appropriate moisture levels
• Shelter and nesting sites
• Suitable temperature ranges and climate conditions
• Protection from predators

Adaptations are specialized features:
• Structural adaptations (physical features like beaks, claws, fur)
• Behavioral adaptations (migration patterns, hunting strategies)
• Physiological adaptations (internal body processes)

**Real-Life Examples**

• Rain forest animals have adaptations for climbing and living in trees
• Desert animals conserve water and tolerate extreme temperatures  
• Ocean animals have specialized breathing and pressure adaptations
• Arctic animals have insulation and hunting adaptations for cold climates

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't confuse adaptations with learned behaviors - adaptations are inherited traits. Also, avoid thinking animals consciously develop adaptations; they evolve over many generations through natural selection.

**Quick Recap**

Habitats and adaptations work together to explain how animals survive in specific environments. This knowledge helps us understand evolution, biodiversity, and conservation principles.`;

Community helpers are special people who work hard every day to keep our neighborhoods safe, clean, and happy! Some helpers have been around for a very long time (like doctors and teachers), while others are newer (like computer repair people). They're like real-life superheroes who help make our community a better place!

**Why Community Helpers Past and Present Matter**

Learning about community helpers helps you understand how people work together to take care of each other. It shows you all the different ways people can help their neighbors and gives you ideas for how you might want to help your community when you grow up!

**How Community Helpers Past and Present Work**

Community helpers have special jobs:
• Some keep us safe (like police officers and firefighters)
• Some help us learn (like teachers and librarians)  
• Some keep us healthy (like doctors and dentists)
• Some deliver things we need (like mail carriers and grocery store workers)

Long ago, some helpers did their jobs differently:
• Doctors used to make house calls with horse and buggy
• Teachers taught all grades in one room
• People got milk delivered to their doors
• Firefighters used horse-drawn fire trucks

**Real-Life Examples**

• Police officers today use cars and computers, but they still help keep people safe like they did 100 years ago
• Teachers used to write on chalkboards, now they use smart boards and tablets
• Mail carriers used to only deliver letters, now they bring packages from online shopping
• Firefighters now have better equipment, but they still rescue people and put out fires

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't think that old ways were always worse - sometimes they were different but still worked well! Also remember that new community helpers keep appearing as our world changes.

**Quick Recap**

Community helpers are important people who take care of our neighborhoods. Some helpers have been around forever, some have changed how they work, and some are brand new. They all help make our community strong!`;

        return `**What Are Fractions?**

Fractions are like pieces of a puzzle or slices of a pizza! When you break something whole into equal parts, each part is called a fraction. It's like sharing - when you split a cookie in half, each half is a fraction of the whole cookie!

**Why Fractions Matter**

You use fractions every day without even knowing it! When you eat half a sandwich, drink a quarter of your milk, or share toys equally with friends, you're using fractions. They help us share things fairly and measure parts of wholes.

**How Fractions Work**

A fraction has two parts:
• The bottom number (denominator) tells you how many equal pieces the whole thing is divided into
• The top number (numerator) tells you how many pieces you have

For example, in 1/2:
• The 2 means the whole is cut into 2 equal pieces
• The 1 means you have 1 of those pieces

**Real-Life Examples**

• Pizza slices - if you eat 2 slices out of 8, you ate 2/8 of the pizza
• Time - half an hour is 1/2 of a whole hour
• Money - a quarter coin is 1/4 of a dollar
• Sharing - if 3 friends share 6 cookies equally, each gets 2/6 of the cookies

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't think bigger numbers always mean bigger fractions! 1/2 is actually bigger than 1/4, even though 4 is bigger than 2. Think of it like pizza - half a pizza is more than a quarter of a pizza!

**Quick Recap**

Fractions are parts of a whole. The bottom number shows how many equal pieces there are, and the top number shows how many pieces you have. Fractions help us share and measure parts of things!`;
    } else {
        return `**What Are Fractions?**

Fractions represent parts of a whole or equal parts of a set. They are rational numbers that express the relationship between a part and the whole, allowing us to work with quantities that fall between whole numbers.

**Why Fractions Matter**

Fractions are essential for understanding proportional relationships, measurement, probability, and advanced mathematical concepts. They appear in cooking recipes, construction measurements, scientific calculations, and financial planning.

**How Fractions Work**

A fraction consists of:
• Numerator (top number): indicates how many parts we have
• Denominator (bottom number): indicates total equal parts in the whole
• The fraction bar represents division

Key concepts include:
• Equivalent fractions (different forms of the same value)
• Proper fractions (numerator < denominator)
• Improper fractions (numerator ≥ denominator)
• Mixed numbers (whole number + fraction)

**Real-Life Examples**

• Recipe measurements (3/4 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt)
• Construction and engineering (precise measurements and tolerances)
• Statistics and data analysis (representing portions of populations)
• Financial calculations (interest rates, stock prices, percentages)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't add fractions by adding numerators and denominators separately - you must find common denominators first. Also, remember that larger denominators create smaller fraction values when numerators are equal.

**Quick Recap**

Fractions represent parts of wholes and are fundamental to advanced mathematics. Understanding equivalent fractions, operations, and real-world applications builds a strong foundation for algebra and beyond.`;

function generateAddSubContent(grade) {
    if (grade === 2) {
        return `**What Are Addition and Subtraction?**

Addition and subtraction are like magic math tools! Addition is putting things together to make bigger groups (like collecting stickers), and subtraction is taking things away to make smaller groups (like eating cookies from a jar). They're opposites that work together!

**Why Addition and Subtraction Matter**

You use these every day! When you count your toys, figure out how much money you have, or see how many cookies are left after snack time, you're using addition and subtraction. They help you solve everyday problems!

**How Addition and Subtraction Work**

**Addition (+):**
When you add, you put groups together:
• 3 apples + 2 apples = 5 apples total
• Start with the first number, then count up by the second number

**Subtraction (−):**
When you subtract, you take away from a group:
• 5 cookies − 2 cookies = 3 cookies left
• Start with the bigger number, then count backwards

**Real-Life Examples**

• You have 4 toy cars and get 3 more for your birthday: 4 + 3 = 7 cars
• There are 10 birds in a tree and 4 fly away: 10 − 4 = 6 birds left
• You save 5 dollars, then spend 2 dollars: 5 − 2 = 3 dollars remaining
• Two friends bring 6 stickers each to trade: 6 + 6 = 12 stickers total

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Remember the order matters in subtraction! You can't take 8 away from 3 (you'd need more than 3 to start with). In addition, order doesn't matter - 2 + 5 is the same as 5 + 2.

**Quick Recap**

Addition puts things together to make bigger amounts, and subtraction takes things away to make smaller amounts. These are some of the most useful math skills you'll ever learn!`;
    } else {
        return `**What Are Addition and Subtraction?**

Addition and subtraction are fundamental arithmetic operations that form the basis for all mathematical computation. Addition combines quantities to find totals, while subtraction finds differences between quantities or determines remaining amounts.

**Why Addition and Subtraction Matter**

These operations are essential for problem-solving across all areas of mathematics and real-world applications. They support understanding of number relationships, algebraic thinking, and complex mathematical reasoning.

**How Addition and Subtraction Work**

**Addition principles:**
• Commutative property: order doesn't matter (a + b = b + a)
• Associative property: grouping doesn't matter ((a + b) + c = a + (b + c))
• Identity property: adding zero doesn't change the value (a + 0 = a)

**Subtraction principles:**
• Not commutative: order matters (a − b ≠ b − a)
• Relationship to addition: subtraction is the inverse of addition
• Can be verified by addition: if a − b = c, then c + b = a

**Real-Life Examples**

• Financial calculations: budgeting, banking, expense tracking
• Measurement: calculating distances, differences in temperature
• Data analysis: finding changes over time, comparing quantities
• Problem-solving: determining needed resources, calculating changes

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't confuse regrouping (borrowing) in subtraction with carrying in addition. Also, be careful with word problems - identify whether you're combining quantities (addition) or finding differences/remaining amounts (subtraction).

**Quick Recap**

Addition and subtraction are inverse operations that form the foundation of mathematical thinking. Mastering these operations and their properties enables success in algebra, geometry, and advanced mathematics.`;

function generateMultiplicationContent(grade) {
    if (grade === 4) {
        return `**What Is Multiplication?**

Multiplication is like addition's super-speedy cousin! Instead of adding the same number over and over again, multiplication lets you jump to the answer quickly. Think of it as counting groups of things all at once - it's like having a math superpower!

**Why Multiplication Matters**

Multiplication helps you solve problems faster and understand patterns in numbers. You'll use it for calculating areas, finding totals in equal groups, understanding arrays, and solving real-world problems involving repeated addition.

**How Multiplication Works**

Multiplication has special properties that make it powerful:
• It's repeated addition: 4 × 3 means 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
• Order doesn't matter: 4 × 3 = 3 × 4 (commutative property)
• You can break apart numbers: 6 × 8 = (6 × 4) + (6 × 4) = 24 + 24 = 48

**Multiplication strategies:**
• Arrays: arrange objects in equal rows and columns
• Skip counting: count by groups (2, 4, 6, 8 for 2×4)
• Doubling: use known facts to find new ones
• Breaking apart: split larger numbers into easier parts

**Real-Life Examples**

• If you buy 3 packs of gum with 5 pieces each: 3 × 5 = 15 pieces total
• A classroom has 6 rows of desks with 4 desks in each row: 6 × 4 = 24 desks
• You save $7 per week for 8 weeks: 7 × 8 = $56 saved
• A garden has 9 rows with 6 plants each: 9 × 6 = 54 plants total

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't forget that any number times zero equals zero, and any number times one stays the same. Also, be careful with word problems - look for keywords like "groups of," "each," "per," and "times" that signal multiplication.

**Quick Recap**

Multiplication is repeated addition that helps you calculate quickly and efficiently. Understanding multiplication facts, properties, and strategies will make you a confident problem-solver!`;

function generatePlaceValueContent(grade) {
    if (grade === 2) {
        return `**What Is Place Value?**

Place value is like giving each number digit a special job! Every digit in a number has its own important place, just like how each player on a sports team has their own position. The place where a digit sits tells us how much it's really worth!

**Why Place Value Matters**

Understanding place value helps you read big numbers, do math problems correctly, and understand how our number system works. It's like learning the secret code that makes all numbers make sense!

**How Place Value Works**

Each place has a special value:
• Ones place: worth exactly what the digit says (5 ones = 5)
• Tens place: worth 10 times the digit (5 tens = 50)
• Hundreds place: worth 100 times the digit (5 hundreds = 500)

For the number 347:
• 3 is in the hundreds place, so it means 300
• 4 is in the tens place, so it means 40  
• 7 is in the ones place, so it means 7
• Together: 300 + 40 + 7 = 347

**Real-Life Examples**

• House numbers: 123 Oak Street means 1 hundred, 2 tens, 3 ones
• Money: $248 means 2 hundred-dollar bills, 4 ten-dollar bills, 8 one-dollar bills
• Scoreboards: A score of 156 means 1 hundred, 5 tens, 6 ones
• Page numbers: Page 89 means 8 tens and 9 ones

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't think that bigger digits are always worth more! In the number 19, the 1 is worth 10 and the 9 is worth 9, so the 1 is actually worth more because of its place.

**Quick Recap**

Place value tells us what each digit in a number is really worth based on where it sits. Understanding place value helps you read, write, and work with numbers correctly!`;
    } else {
        return `**What Is Place Value?**

Place value is the foundation of our base-ten number system, where the position of each digit determines its actual value. This positional system allows us to represent any quantity using just ten digits (0-9) by assigning different values to different positions.

**Why Place Value Matters**

Place value understanding is essential for all mathematical operations, number sense development, and working with large numbers. It underlies decimal operations, scientific notation, and helps students understand number relationships and patterns.

**How Place Value Works**

Our decimal system is based on powers of 10:
• Each place value is 10 times greater than the place to its right
• Each place value is 1/10 the value of the place to its left
• Standard form, expanded form, and word form all represent the same value

Example with 5,847:
• 5 thousands = 5 × 1,000 = 5,000
• 8 hundreds = 8 × 100 = 800
• 4 tens = 4 × 10 = 40
• 7 ones = 7 × 1 = 7
• Total value: 5,000 + 800 + 40 + 7 = 5,847

**Real-Life Examples**

• Population statistics and large data sets
• Scientific measurements and calculations
• Financial calculations and monetary systems
• Geographic measurements (distances, elevations)
• Technology (computer memory, processing speeds)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't confuse digit value with place value - the digit 5 always represents five of something, but its place determines what it's five of (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.). Also, remember that zero serves as a placeholder to maintain correct place values.

**Quick Recap**

Place value is the positional system that gives meaning to digits based on their location in a number. Mastering place value concepts is essential for number sense and all mathematical operations.`;

function generateMeasurementContent(grade) {
    if (grade === 2) {
        return `**What Is Measurement?**

Measurement is like being a detective who figures out how big, long, heavy, or full something is! We use special tools and units to describe the size of things around us. It's like giving everything a number so we can compare and understand them better!

**Why Measurement Matters**

You use measurement every day! When you see how tall you've grown, check if your clothes fit, or help cook dinner by measuring ingredients, you're using measurement skills. It helps us build things, share fairly, and understand our world!

**How Measurement Works**

We measure different things in different ways:
• **Length:** How long or tall something is (inches, feet, centimeters)
• **Weight:** How heavy something is (pounds, ounces, kilograms)  
• **Volume:** How much liquid fits in something (cups, pints, liters)
• **Time:** How long something takes (seconds, minutes, hours)

**Tools we use:**
• Rulers and measuring tapes for length
• Scales for weight
• Measuring cups for liquids
• Clocks and timers for time

**Real-Life Examples**

• Measuring your height to see how much you've grown
• Using measuring cups to make cookies with the right amount of flour
• Weighing packages at the post office to know how much postage costs
• Timing how long it takes to run around the playground

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Always start measuring from the zero mark on your ruler, not from the end! Also, make sure you're using the right unit - don't measure a pencil in feet or your height in inches (well, you could, but it would be a really big number!).

    } else {
        return `**What Are Patterns and Functions?**

Patterns and functions are mathematical relationships that describe predictable sequences and changes. Functions define rules that connect input values to output values, while patterns show regular, predictable arrangements or sequences.

**Why Patterns and Functions Matter**

Understanding patterns and functions is fundamental to algebraic thinking and problem-solving. These concepts help us model real-world relationships, make predictions, and develop logical reasoning skills essential for advanced mathematics.

**How Patterns and Functions Work**

**Types of Patterns:**

**Numeric Patterns:**
• Arithmetic sequences (constant difference)
• Geometric sequences (constant ratio)
• Fibonacci sequence (each number is sum of previous two)
• Prime numbers

**Function Types:**
• Linear functions (constant rate of change)
• Quadratic functions (variable rate of change)
• Input-output relationships
• Function rules and notation

**Pattern Analysis:**
• Identify the pattern rule
• Find missing terms
• Extend patterns
• Create function tables
• Graph relationships

**Real-Life Examples**

• Population growth patterns
• Temperature changes
• Financial interest calculations
• Scientific phenomena
• Computer algorithms

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't assume all patterns continue indefinitely without verifying the rule. Also, remember that correlation doesn't always imply causation - patterns may be coincidental rather than meaningful.

**Quick Recap**

Patterns and functions are powerful tools for understanding relationships and making predictions. They form the foundation for algebraic thinking and help us model real-world phenomena mathematically.`;

function generateMainIdeaContent(grade) {
    if (grade === 2) {
        return `**What Is Main Idea?**

The main idea is what a story or text is mostly about! It's like the big picture or the most important message the author wants to share. Details in the story help support the main idea, just like legs support a table!

**Why Main Idea Matters**

Understanding the main idea helps you remember what you read and tell others about it. It's like being able to tell someone what a movie was about without telling them every little thing that happened!

**How Main Idea Works**

**Finding the Main Idea:**
• Look at the title
• Read the first and last paragraphs
• Notice what the author talks about most
• Think about what all the details have in common

**Supporting Details:**
• Give examples
• Explain more about the main idea
• Help you understand better
• Add interesting information

**Steps to Find Main Idea:**
1. Read the whole text carefully
2. Ask "What is this mostly about?"
3. Look for important details
4. Think about how details connect

**Real-Life Examples**

• A birthday party's main idea is celebrating someone's birthday
• A recipe's main idea is how to make something
• A weather report's main idea is what the weather will be like
• A stop sign's main idea is to tell cars to stop

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't confuse a small detail with the main idea! Also, remember that the title sometimes helps you find the main idea, but not always - you need to read the whole text.

**Quick Recap**

The main idea is what something is mostly about, and details help explain and support it. Finding the main idea helps you understand and remember what you read!`;
    } else {
        return `**What Is Main Idea?**

The main idea is the central concept or primary message of a text. It encompasses the essential information the author wants to convey, supported by relevant details and examples that develop and clarify the central theme.

**Why Main Idea Matters**

Identifying main ideas is crucial for reading comprehension, critical thinking, and effective communication. This skill helps readers synthesize information, distinguish between essential and supporting details, and understand author's purpose.

**How Main Idea Works**

**Levels of Main Ideas:**

**Text Level:**
• Overall theme or message
• Author's primary purpose
• Central argument or concept

**Paragraph Level:**
• Topic sentences
• Supporting details
• Concluding statements

**Identifying Main Ideas:**
• Analyze text structure
• Evaluate supporting details
• Consider author's purpose
• Examine text features

**Supporting Details:**
• Examples and evidence
• Statistics and data
• Explanations
• Illustrations and quotes

**Real-Life Examples**

• News article headlines and key points
• Research paper thesis statements
• Textbook chapter main concepts
• Speech central messages
• Documentary themes

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Don't confuse interesting details with main ideas. Remember that main ideas may be stated or implied, and multiple paragraphs may support a single main idea. Also, distinguish between topic (subject) and main idea (what's said about the subject).

**Quick Recap**

Main idea identification is essential for comprehension and analysis. Understanding how main ideas are supported by details helps readers grasp meaning and author's purpose in various texts.`;
