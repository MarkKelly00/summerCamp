            introduction: "Get ready to become a skip counting superhero! We're going to learn how to count by 5s, which is like taking giant kangaroo hops instead of tiny baby steps. When you skip count by 5s, you jump over numbers and land on every 5th number!",
            content: "What Is Skip Counting by 5s? Skip counting by 5s means we count in jumps of 5 instead of counting every single number. Instead of saying 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, we jump and say 5, 10! Step-by-Step Method: 1. Start at 5, 2. Add 5 more: 5 + 5 = 10, 3. Add 5 more: 10 + 5 = 15, 4. Keep adding 5: 15 + 5 = 20, 20 + 5 = 25, etc. The Pattern: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50. Helpful Tricks: Use your fingers! Each hand has 5 fingers. Look at a clock - the numbers go by 5s around the edge. Count nickels - each nickel is worth 5 cents. Think of groups of 5 objects. Why Skip Counting by 5s Matters: This helps you count faster and prepares you for multiplication. 3 groups of 5 = 5, 10, 15! Real-Life Examples: Counting fingers: 5 (one hand), 10 (two hands), 15 (three hands). Counting nickels: 5¢, 10¢, 15¢, 20¢. Telling time: 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes. Common Mistakes to Avoid: Don't say the numbers in between! Jump straight from 5 to 10, not 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.",

            content: "What Is Subtraction Within 100? Subtraction means taking away or finding the difference between numbers. When we subtract within 100, we work with numbers from 0 to 100. Step-by-Step Subtraction Methods: Method 1 - Counting Back: For 15 - 6, start at 15 and count back 6 numbers: 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9. Answer: 9. Method 2 - Using a Number Line: For 23 - 7, find 23 on the number line and jump back 7 spaces to get 16. Method 3 - Break Apart Numbers: For 35 - 18, break 18 into 10 + 8. First subtract 10: 35 - 10 = 25. Then subtract 8: 25 - 8 = 17. Method 4 - Column Subtraction: Line up the ones and tens places. When borrowing, remember to reduce the number you borrowed from. Key Subtraction Facts: Any number minus 0 equals itself. Any number minus itself equals 0. You can check by adding back. Real-Life Examples: You have 24 stickers and give away 8: 24 - 8 = 16 stickers left. There are 50 kids at recess and 12 go inside: 50 - 12 = 38 kids still outside.",

            content: "What Is Addition with Two-Digit Numbers? Two-digit addition means adding numbers that have two digits, like 23 + 45. Every two-digit number has a tens place and a ones place. Understanding Place Value: In 47, the 4 is in the tens place (40), 7 is in the ones place (7). So 47 = 40 + 7. Step-by-Step Addition Methods: Method 1 - Add the Parts: For 25 + 34, add the tens: 20 + 30 = 50. Add the ones: 5 + 4 = 9. Put them together: 50 + 9 = 59. Method 2 - Column Addition: Line up the ones and tens places. Add the ones column first, then the tens column. Method 3 - Adding with Regrouping: When ones add up to 10 or more, carry the extra ten to the tens column. Mental Math Tricks: Round to nearest 10, then adjust. Use doubles when possible. Real-Life Examples: You have 16 toy cars and get 28 more: 16 + 28 = 44 cars total. Your class has 24 boys and 19 girls: 24 + 19 = 43 students. Common Mistakes: Always line up the ones with ones and tens with tens. Don't forget to carry when the sum is 10 or more!",

            content: "What Are Area and Perimeter? Perimeter is the distance around the outside edge of a shape. Area is the amount of space inside a shape. Step-by-Step Formulas: For Rectangles - Perimeter = 2 × length + 2 × width (or add all 4 sides), Area = length × width. For Squares - Perimeter = 4 × side length, Area = side × side. Worked Examples: Example 1 - Rectangle Garden: Length = 8 feet, Width = 5 feet. Perimeter = 2(8) + 2(5) = 16 + 10 = 26 feet. Area = 8 × 5 = 40 square feet. Example 2 - Square Bedroom: Side = 12 feet. Perimeter = 4 × 12 = 48 feet. Area = 12 × 12 = 144 square feet. Units Are Important! Perimeter uses linear units: feet, meters, inches. Area uses square units: square feet, square meters. Problem-Solving Steps: 1. Identify if you need perimeter or area, 2. Identify the shape, 3. Find the measurements, 4. Use the correct formula, 5. Include proper units. Real-World Applications: Farmers calculate area to know how much seed to plant. Builders calculate perimeter to know how much fencing to buy. Critical Thinking: Can two shapes have the same perimeter but different areas? YES! Rectangle A: 6 × 2 has perimeter 16 and area 12. Rectangle B: 5 × 3 has perimeter 16 and area 15.",

            content: "What Were Colonial America and Early Settlements? Colonial America was the period from 1607-1776 when European countries established settlements in North America. A colony is a settlement controlled by a distant country. Major Early Settlements: Jamestown, Virginia (1607) - English settlers sent by the Virginia Company to find gold and get rich. They faced disease, starvation, and conflicts but succeeded by growing tobacco. Plymouth, Massachusetts (1620) - Pilgrims seeking religious freedom traveled 66 days on the Mayflower. They received help from Native Americans and celebrated the first Thanksgiving. Massachusetts Bay Colony (1630) - Puritans led by John Winthrop wanted to create a perfect religious community. Pennsylvania (1681) - Quakers led by William Penn promoted religious tolerance and fair treatment of Native Americans. Why People Came to America: Economic Reasons - escape poverty, own land, trade opportunities. Religious Reasons - freedom to worship, escape persecution, create perfect Christian communities. Social Reasons - fresh start, adventure, avoid wars in Europe. Daily Life in Colonial America: Housing - log cabins or simple wooden houses with one or two rooms. Food - corn, beans, squash (learned from Native Americans), hunting and fishing. Work - farming for most people, skilled crafts, children started working at age 6-7. Education - few schools mostly for boys, children learned by watching adults. Challenges Faced: harsh winters, diseases like smallpox, food shortages, conflicts with Native Americans, homesickness. Legacy: established ideas of religious freedom, self-government, hard work, foundation for the United States.",
