        grade4: {
            introduction: "Welcome to the fascinating world of matter! Today we're going to explore how matter can change between solid, liquid, and gas states. Think of water turning into ice or steam - these amazing transformations happen all around us every day!",
            mainContent: `## What Are States of Matter and Physical Changes?

States of matter are the different forms that matter can take: **solid**, **liquid**, and **gas**. Physical changes happen when matter changes from one state to another without becoming a new substance.

## Why States of Matter and Physical Changes Matter

Understanding states of matter helps us:
- Explain everyday phenomena like ice melting or water boiling
- Understand weather patterns and the water cycle
- Design better materials and products
- Cook and prepare food properly

## How States of Matter Work

### The Three Main States:

**Solids:**
- Particles are tightly packed in fixed positions
- Have definite shape and volume
- Examples: ice, rocks, wood, metal

**Liquids:**
- Particles are close but can move past each other
- Have definite volume but take the shape of their container
- Examples: water, milk, oil, juice

**Gases:**
- Particles are far apart and move freely
- Have no definite shape or volume
- Examples: air, water vapor, helium

### Physical Changes Between States:

**Melting:** Solid → Liquid (ice melting into water)
**Freezing:** Liquid → Solid (water freezing into ice)
**Evaporation:** Liquid → Gas (water turning into steam)
**Condensation:** Gas → Liquid (steam turning back to water)

## Real-World Examples

- Ice cubes melting in your drink
- Morning dew forming on grass (condensation)
- Puddles disappearing on a sunny day (evaporation)
- Making ice cream (freezing)
- Fog forming on cold mornings

## Key Concepts to Remember

Temperature is the key factor in state changes. Adding heat energy makes particles move faster (solid → liquid → gas), while removing heat makes them slow down (gas → liquid → solid).`,

            mainContent: `## What Are Multiplication and Division Facts?

Multiplication and division facts are the basic equations you need to know by heart. They're like math's alphabet - once you know them, you can solve bigger problems easily!

## Why Multiplication and Division Facts Matter

Knowing these facts helps you:
- Solve math problems quickly and accurately
- Understand fractions, decimals, and percentages
- Calculate area, perimeter, and volume
- Handle real-world math like shopping and cooking

## Key Multiplication Facts to Master

### The Basics (0-5):
- **0 times any number = 0**
- **1 times any number = that number**
- **2s:** Double the number (2×6=12)
- **5s:** Count by 5s (5×6=30)
- **10s:** Add a zero (10×6=60)

### The Middle Facts (6-9):
- **6s:** Often relate to 3s doubled
- **7s:** The trickiest - need extra practice
- **8s:** Often relate to 4s doubled
- **9s:** Use the finger trick!

### Division as Inverse:
- If 6 × 7 = 42, then 42 ÷ 6 = 7
- If 8 × 9 = 72, then 72 ÷ 8 = 9

## Strategies for Learning Facts

**Skip Counting:** Great for 2s, 5s, and 10s
**Doubling:** Use known facts to find new ones
**Patterns:** Look for patterns in multiplication tables
**Arrays:** Visualize multiplication as rows and columns

## Real-World Applications

            introduction: "Welcome to the exciting world of coding! Today we'll learn how to think like a programmer and understand the basic building blocks that make all computer programs work. It's like learning a new language that lets you create amazing things!",
            mainContent: `## What Are Basic Coding Concepts?

Coding concepts are the fundamental ideas that all computer programs use. Think of them as the grammar rules of programming languages - once you understand these concepts, you can learn any programming language!

## Why Basic Coding Concepts Matter

Understanding coding helps you:
- Develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Create games, apps, and websites
- Understand how technology works
- Prepare for future careers
- Express creativity through technology

## Key Coding Concepts

### 1. Algorithms (Step-by-Step Instructions)
An algorithm is a set of clear instructions to solve a problem. Like a recipe for baking cookies, each step must be in the right order.

### 2. Sequences
Commands that run one after another in order:
- Move forward
- Turn right
- Move forward
- Pick up object

### 3. Loops (Repetition)
Repeating actions multiple times:
- **For Loop:** Repeat exactly 5 times
- **While Loop:** Repeat while a condition is true

### 4. Conditionals (If-Then Decisions)
Making choices based on conditions:
- IF it's raining THEN take umbrella
- IF score > 100 THEN display "You Win!"

### 5. Variables (Information Storage)
Containers that hold information:
- playerScore = 0
- playerName = "Alex"
- lives = 3

## How These Concepts Work Together

Programs combine these concepts to create complex behaviors. A simple game might:
1. Set variables (score = 0)
2. Use a loop to keep the game running
3. Use conditionals to check if player wins
4. Follow sequences of game actions

## Real-World Examples

- Traffic lights use conditionals (IF cars waiting THEN turn green)
- Music playlists use loops (repeat songs)
- Video games use all concepts together
- Robots follow algorithmic instructions`,

        grade4: {
            introduction: "Get ready to explore the invisible forces that make everything move! From throwing a ball to riding a bike, forces and motion are everywhere. Today we'll discover the science behind every push, pull, and movement in our world!",
            mainContent: `## What Are Forces and Motion?

A **force** is a push or pull that can change an object's motion. **Motion** is the change in an object's position over time. Together, they explain how and why things move!

## Why Forces and Motion Matter

Understanding forces and motion helps us:
- Design safer cars and buildings
- Play sports better
- Understand how machines work
- Predict how objects will move
- Build roller coasters and playground equipment

## Types of Forces

### Contact Forces (touching required):
- **Push:** Moving something away from you
- **Pull:** Moving something toward you
- **Friction:** Force that slows things down

### Non-Contact Forces (no touching needed):
- **Gravity:** Pulls everything toward Earth
- **Magnetism:** Attracts or repels magnetic materials

## Newton's Laws of Motion

### First Law (Inertia):
Objects at rest stay at rest, objects in motion stay in motion unless a force acts on them.

### Second Law (F = ma):
The bigger the force, the bigger the acceleration. Heavier objects need more force to move.

### Third Law (Action-Reaction):
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

## How Forces Affect Motion

- **Balanced Forces:** Object stays still or moves at constant speed
- **Unbalanced Forces:** Object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction

## Measuring Motion

- **Speed:** How fast something moves (distance ÷ time)
- **Velocity:** Speed with direction
- **Acceleration:** Change in velocity

## Real-World Examples

- Kicking a soccer ball (force changes its motion)
- Sliding on ice (less friction = more motion)
- Dropping a ball (gravity pulls it down)
- Riding a bike uphill (working against gravity)
- Seatbelts in cars (preventing motion during stops)`,

            mainContent: `## What Are Pushes and Pulls?

A **push** is when you use force to move something away from you. A **pull** is when you use force to bring something closer to you. These are the two main ways we make things move!

## Why Pushes and Pulls Matter

Understanding pushes and pulls helps you:
- Know how to move things safely
- Play games and sports better
- Understand how toys and machines work
- Be a better helper at home

## How Pushes and Pulls Work

### Push Forces:
- Make things move away
- Can make things start moving
- Can make things stop
- Examples: pushing a swing, kicking a ball

### Pull Forces:
- Make things come closer
- Can change direction
- Can lift things up
- Examples: pulling a wagon, opening a door

### Big and Small Forces:
- **Gentle push/pull:** Moves things slowly
- **Strong push/pull:** Moves things fast
- **No push/pull:** Things stay still

## Forces All Around Us

Every movement needs a force:
- Opening a book (pull)
- Closing a door (push)
- Picking up a toy (pull)
- Throwing a ball (push)

## Special Force: Gravity

Gravity is a pull that Earth makes on everything. It's why:
- Things fall down, not up
- We stay on the ground
- Balls come back down when thrown up`,
